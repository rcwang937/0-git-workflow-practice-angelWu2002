**Thoughts**
The concept of edge computing in public transport, as illustrated by the Icomera X7 mobile-edge routers, is genuinely intriguing. Personally, I find the idea of transforming a public transport vehicle into a mini data center quite revolutionary. This not only speeds up data processing, making it nearly real-time, but also drastically reduces the dependency on distant cloud servers. The immediate processing of data right where it's generated – on the vehicles themselves – is a smart move, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness of the public transport system.

Equally fascinating is how this technology champions data security. In an era where data breaches are a significant concern, processing sensitive information locally on the vehicle strengthens security. It’s impressive how a single onboard system can manage various tasks, from safety monitoring to passenger counting, without compromising data privacy. This seamless integration of multiple functions into one unified system onboard a vehicle feels like a glimpse into the future of public transport – smarter, safer, and more passenger-oriented.
